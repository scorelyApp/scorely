                    We collect anonymous, aggregated usage data to improve Scorely and understand what features 
                    matter most to our community. This includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Usage:</strong> Which games you play most often (e.g., Catan, Ticket to Ride)</li>
                    <li><strong>Player Counts:</strong> How many players typically join your games (e.g., 2-4 players)</li>
                    <li><strong>Game Duration:</strong> How long games usually last</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Usage:</strong> Which app features are used most (e.g., score tracking, templates)</li>
                    <li><strong>App Performance:</strong> Crashes, errors, and technical issues (to fix bugs)</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> iOS version, device model (for compatibility testing)</li>

                    data back to you as an individual. We use Firebase Analytics, which respects user privacy and 
                    does not collect PII.
